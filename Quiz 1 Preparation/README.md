# Quiz 1 Information

Quiz 1 covers **Linear Classifiers and Gradient Descent (Lesson 1)** and **Neural Networks (Lesson 2)** and is due **January 22nd, 08:00 am ET (NO GRACE PERIOD)**. The quiz is *closed notes/book/internet* but you can use scratch paper and the [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/scientific) scientific calculator (we will use Honorlock for proctoring which also provides its own scientific calculator).

## Some things to remember:

- Please show both sides of all blank scratch paper during the room scan.
- You **CANNOT** use your own physical calculator.
- Please do not discuss the quiz contents or their solutions with other students.

The quiz will consist of approximately 20 questions, split between **60% (conceptual)** and **40% (computation)**. It is untimed, but students typically take around 30 to 45 minutes for this first quiz.

Quiz questions may consist of multiple choice, True/False, check all that apply, and computations. In terms of topics, we will typically provide hints on areas of focus that will dominate the quiz. Here are some for this quiz:

### Concepts:

- Gradient descent and properties (local minima, etc.)
- Backpropagation (what partial derivatives are computed, chain rule, etc.)
- Representational power of neural networks, auto-differentiation
- How computation graphs work, what properties the graph requires (DAG), ordering, etc.
- Know when functions are differentiable and not-differentiable
- Differences between parametric/non-parametric models

### Computation-related questions:

- You will be asked to take partial derivatives of multi-variate functions with respect to a particular variable. You should know the derivatives of common functions (e^x, sigmoid, sin, cos, ln, etc.)
- Jacobians and calculating particular values within a Jacobian
- Derivatives of composed functions
- Computing partial derivatives through a computation graph

**Remember to check whether the calculator is set to degrees or radians!**
