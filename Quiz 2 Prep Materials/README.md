# Quiz 2 Information

Quiz 2 will cover **Optimization of Deep Neural Networks (Lesson 3)** and **Convolution and Pooling Layers (Lesson 5)** and it will be due **February 5th 8:00 AM ET (NO GRACE PERIOD)**. The quiz is **closed notes/book/internet** but you can use scratch paper and the desmos scientific calculator (we will use Honorlock for proctoring, which provides its own scientific calculator). You **CANNOT** use your own physical calculator.

**Please do not discuss** the quiz contents or their solutions with other students.

The quiz will consist of approximately 20 questions, split between **80% (conceptual)** and **20% (computation)**. As with other quizzes, it is untimed.

## Conceptual Questions:

- Activation functions and their properties, including relative comparisons between them
- The algorithms and properties of the following (including comparing different algorithms within these groups):
  - Initialization
  - Optimizers
  - Regularization methods and their properties, including dropout
  - Batch normalization
- DL book: How batch sizes affects optimization (Chapter 8)
- DL book: Supervised Pre-training (Chapter 8)
- Convolution

## Computation Questions:

- Sizes of convolution and pooling layer outputs
- Number of parameters of convolution layers

## Practice Computation Problem Set:

Weâ€™ve created a problem set for a flavor of the types of computation questions you should expect:
