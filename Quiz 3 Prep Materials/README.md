# Quiz 3 Overview

**Coverage**: 
- **Lesson 6**: Convolutional Neural Network Architectures
- **Lesson 7**: Visualization
- **Lesson 9**: Advanced Computer Vision Architectures

**Due Date**: February 26th, 8:00 AM ET  
**Important**: No grace period allowed.

### Focus Topics

#### Conceptual Questions:
- Types of errors and what they mean
- Effectiveness of transfer learning under certain conditions
- Differences between different types of modern architectures (AlexNet, VGGNet, Inception Net, ResNet)
- Convolutional layers and how they work (forward/backward)
- Invariance vs. equivariance
- Backprop-based visualization
- Adversarial examples
- Loss functions we've covered so far (including style transfer)
- Object detection architectures (including outputs, losses, etc.)
- Receptive fields
- Transpose convolution

#### Computation Questions:
- Number of parameters and memory requirements across a CNN (e.g., number of trainable parameters, number of activations)
- Forward and backward computation across a convolution layer

**Breakdown**: Approximately 20% computation and 80% conceptual.
